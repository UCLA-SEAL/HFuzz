# STATUS FILE for HFuzz Artifact Evaluation

## Functional Badge
The HFuzz artifact satisfies the criteria for the Functional badge for the following reasons:

1. **Documented**: Comprehensive documentation is provided with the artifact, including detailed instructions on how to set up, run, and interpret the results. Examples and use-cases have been included to guide users.

2. **Consistent**: The artifact has been thoroughly tested, and the results obtained are consistent with those presented in the paper. The consistency has been verified across different hardware setups and environments, reflecting the real heterogeneous architectures targeted by HFuzz.

3. **Complete**: The artifact includes all the necessary components, data, and dependencies to reproduce the results presented in the paper. 

4. **Exercisable**: We provide scripts and easy-to-follow guides that allow users to readily execute the artifact, even without specialized knowledge in the field.

## Available Badge
The HFuzz artifact also satisfies the criteria for the Available badge, as outlined below:

1. **Public Repository**: The complete artifact, including code, data, documentation, and supporting materials, has been placed in a publicly accessible archival repository.

By fulfilling the criteria for both badges, we believe the HFuzz artifact substantially contributes to the research community's ability to understand, validate, and extend our work. We commit to maintaining the accessibility and functionality of the artifact and providing support for users if needed.
